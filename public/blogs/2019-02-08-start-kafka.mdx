For both data engineers and DevOps, setting up a real-time data pipeline
is no trivial task, yet, such architectures are immensely useful,
for instance, real-time recommendation engine, real-time geo-location
visualization.

One of the most commonly used solution for such pipeline is **Apache Kafka**.
Developed by Linkedin in 2011, Kafka has been slowly growing into a mature
platform for distributed streaming with good scalability, data persistence,
fault-tolerance.

Thanks to the announcement of **Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka**
(AWS MSK in short) in November last year, setting up a production-grade
Kafka cluster that on AWS is not as challenging as it used to be.
In this article, I will go over some of the basics on starting
a bare-bone Kafka cluster both locally and on AWS cloud.

Firstly, let’s go over some brief overview of the basic components of Kafka.

## Basic Components of Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka consists of six core components, namely:
**Broker**, **Topic**, **Consumer**, **Producer**, **Connector**, **Streamer**.

    alt="Relationship between Kafka Components"
  />
  <figcaption>Relationship between Kafka Components</figcaption>
</div>

### Kafka Topic

Kafka topic is a category/grouping for messages, allowing for:

- data partitioning, with an immutable ordered sequence;

- data persistence (retention period is configurable);

- multiple-consumer subscription;

### Kafka Broker

Kafka broker (sometimes referred as Kafka server/node) is the server
node in the cluster, mainly responsible for:

- hosting partitions of Kafka Topics;

- transferring messages from Kafka Producer to Kafka Consumer;

- providing data replication and partitioning within a Kafka Cluster;

### Kafka Consumer

Kafka consumer subscribes to the broker, and consumes data from a topic.
It actively **pulls** data from the specified Kafka Topic
with offset management.

**Kafka consumer group** is a set of consumers consuming data from some topics.
Each partition in the topic is assigned to exactly one member in the group.
Changes of consumer group members result in partitions re-assignment
to consumers.

### Kafka Producer

On the other hand, Kafka producer is responsible for writing data
to a Kafka topic, in the following ways:

- send message to **a** topic partition, then inform the partition leader;

- allow batching and compressing configuration;

- allow optimization between throughput and data guarantees;

### Kafka Connect

To read from or write to various data sources (e.g. databases,
distributed storage), rather than writing a producer or consumer for
each data sources, Apache Kafka provides us a simpler abstraction namely
**Kafka Connect**.

Mainly contributed by [Confluent.io](https://www.confluent.io/) (a company
founded by the creators of Kafka), Kafka Connect is an open source connector
for connecting to various commonly used data sources, for instance, HDFS,
JDBC or NoSQL databases (e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB, Elasticsearch).

The Kafka Connect component that reads from data sources is called
**Source Connector**, and the component that write to data source is called
**Sink Connector**. Both connectors make use of Kafka Connect API, which is
much handier than the Kafka Producer API and Kafka Consumer API.

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/kafka-connect.png"
    alt="“Same same but different”, Kafka Connect makes stream handling easier."
  />
  <figcaption>
    “Same same but different”, Kafka Connect makes stream handling easier.
  </figcaption>
</div>

Hence, using Kafka Connect over Producer and Consumer is recommended,
unless there are no official connectors for your data source (e.g. RabbitMQ,
InfluxDB).

### Kafka Stream

Now with our data sources and sinks ready, we introduces the final
component in Kafka. Kafka Stream is the component that allow us to filter,
transform, and aggregate the data from all the data streams.

There are many streaming processing operations available in the Kafka Stream
APIs, including mapping, reducing, filtering, and window aggregation.
It is also possible to use other frameworks to process Kafka data,
including [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/streaming-kafka-integration.html),
[Apache Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/kafka/),
[Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/blog/review-input-streaming-connectors/),
or even [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

Still, if you are looking for more details,
you can always refer to these resources:

- [Apache Kafka Official Documentation (of course)](https://kafka.apache.org/intro)

- [Kafka concepts and common patterns @ beyondthelines](https://www.beyondthelines.net/computing/kafka-patterns/)

## Local Setup

In this section, I will go over the steps to setup a Kafka cluster locally.
All the sample codes are available in this repository:

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <Git id="https://github.com/kavimaluskam/kafka-starter" />
  <figcaption>Gist video</figcaption>
</div>

### Local cluster architecture

The local cluster architecture is defined in
the file `docker/docker-compose.yml`, which is as follows:

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/local-kafka-docker.png"
    alt="Components of the local Kafka Cluster"
  />
  <figcaption>Components of the local Kafka Cluster</figcaption>
</div>

- **kafka1**, **kafka2** serve as two separate broker nodes.
  With the help of Apache Zookeeper, having two nodes provides us
  higher availability via redundancy;

- **schema_registry** serves as the sole schema server,
  managing the schema (to be explained below) of all Kafka topics;

- **kafdrop**, schema_registry_ui are the optional web UI for the
  Kafka cluster and the schema registry server respectively;

- **postgres** represents the external databases containing
  the application data, which in this demo, the mock data;

- **connect-shell** is the Kafka Connect App for us
  to interact through in the terminal;

### Step 1: Starting the service

To start with, please make sure you have both Docker and Docker Compose
already installed on your machine. Let’s clone the repository and
enter our project directory:

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kavimaluskam/kafka-starter
cd kafka-starter
```

Start services by executing the command `make up`
and services are expected to be running:

```shell
make up     # remember, you need to have docker installed
docker ps
```

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/docker-ps.png" alt="docker-ps" />
  <figcaption>
    Output from the command “docker ps” — you can see the Kafka cluster is now
    ready.
  </figcaption>
</div>

### Step 2: Basic Topic CRUD

After the cluster’s ready, we can now read and write to Kafka topics.
Let’s warm up with Kafka Topic CRUD in the command line interface.

```shell
# Enter Kafka Shell Client
make kafka-shell

# Assign testing topic name in variable
TOPIC=test

# Describe all topic
kafka-topics \
    --describe \
    --zookeeper $ZK

# Create topic
kafka-topics \
    --create \
    --topic $TOPIC \
    --partitions 4 \
    --zookeeper $ZK \
    --replication-factor 2

# Describe partitions, replication, leader brokers for selected topic
kafka-topics \
    --describe \
    --zookeeper $ZK \
    --topic $TOPIC

# Count the number of messages inside a topic
kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell \
    --broker-list=$BROKERS \
    --topic $TOPIC \
    --time -1

# Update retention policy of a topic
# "-1" means forever
kafka-configs \
    --zookeeper $ZK \
    --alter \
    --entity-type topics \
    --entity-name $TOPIC \
    --add-config retention.ms=-1

kafka-configs \
    --zookeeper $ZK \
    --alter \
    --entity-type topics \
    --entity-name $TOPIC \
    --add-config retention.bytes=-1

# Delete topics
kafka-topics \
    --delete \
    --topic $TOPIC \
    --zookeeper $ZK

# Exit Docker when CRUD is done
exit
```

### Step 3: Starting a Producer and Consumer in Console

Using the Kafka Shell Client, we can instantiate a producer / a consumer
application within the terminal. Opening two terminal shells,
and type each of the commands in each separate shell:

```shell
# Enter Kafka Shell Client
make kafka-shell

# Assign topic name in variable
TOPIC=test

# Producer for console text input
kafka-console-producer --topic=$TOPIC --broker-list=$BROKERS

###############################################
# You will then enter console input mode,     #
# each newline will emit a message to Kafka.  #
#                                             #
# Ctrl + C to exit when input is done.        #
###############################################

# Exit Docker when console producer is done
exit
```

<figcaption>Starting a producer with Kafka Shell.</figcaption>

```shell
# Enter Kafka Shell Client
make kafka-shell

# Assign topic name in variable
TOPIC=test

# Consumer for console text output, no stream offset
kafka-console-consumer --topic=$TOPIC --bootstrap-server=$BROKERS --from-beginning

# Console consumer will print each records in the topic
# ...
# ...
# ...

# Exit Docker when console consumer is done
exit
```

<figcaption>Starting a consumer with Kafka Shell.</figcaption>

### Step 4: Kafka Connect (with mock database)

For real-time usage, source data would be coming from different external
sources, rather than manual input from the terminal. To automate the
data connection to data sources, as a proof of concept, we make use of
Kafka Connect to connect to a mock PostgresSQL database.

1. Mock data is ready in the initialization script. Confirm the data by:
   `$ make db-preview`

1. Execute Kafka Connect to the PostgresSQL database, with
   [Kafka Connect docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect/tags)
   provided by Confluent. We can use Kafka Connect on a local
   standalone cluster with the following command:

   ```shell
   connect-standalone worker1.properties connector1.properties [connector2.properties...]
   ```

- **worker1.properties** is a configuration file for the
  **Kafka Connect Worker**, which contains settings such as the
  Kafka cluster location, serialization format, etc.

- **connector{1/2}.properties** is a configuration file for
  **Kafka Connection**, the data sources to be connected
  could be a data source or a data sink.

In the `connect/dev/` directory, some predefined configuration
files are already provided. Hence, we can use the following
command to start a Kafka Connect with JSON serialization:

```shell
# Enter Kafka Connect Shell Client
make connect-shell

# Kafka Connect with connect-standalone setting, connecting via postgres
connect-standalone dev/connect-standalone.properties dev/source-postgres-incremental.properties

# Expected console-consumer output from topic: app-users
# {
#   "schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32","optional":false,"field":"id"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"first_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"last_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"email"}],"optional":false,"name":"users"},
#   "payload":{"id":101,"first_name":"Cass","last_name":"Truss","email":"ctruss0@salon.com"}
# }
# {
#   "schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32","optional":false,"field":"id"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"first_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"last_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"email"}],"optional":false,"name":"users"},
#   "payload":{"id":102,"first_name":"Joete","last_name":"Scowcroft","email":"jscowcroft1@gizmodo.com"}
# }
# {
#   "schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32","optional":false,"field":"id"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"first_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"last_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"email"}],"optional":false,"name":"users"},
#   "payload":{"id":103,"first_name":"Celine","last_name":"Wortley","email":"cwortley2@bizjournals.com"}
# }
# {
#   "schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32","optional":false,"field":"id"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"first_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"last_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"email"}],"optional":false,"name":"users"},
#   "payload":{"id":104,"first_name":"Othilia","last_name":"Gumme","email":"ogumme3@issuu.com"}
# }
# {
#   "schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32","optional":false,"field":"id"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"first_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"last_name"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"email"}],"optional":false,"name":"users"},
#   "payload":{"id":105,"first_name":"Maynord","last_name":"Buttrick","email":"mbuttrick4@mashable.com"}
# }
# ...

# Exit Docker when Kafka Connect is done
(Ctrl-C)
exit
```

Now, Kafka Connect should be able to poll records in a database with
detected schemas and perform JSON serialization. As illustrated above,
we can see that the messages produced are of the following format,
in which `schema` describes the message format and `payload` contains
the actual message content:

```json
[
  {
    "schema":
      {"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"int32",...]...},
    "payload":
      {"id":101,"first_name":...}
  },
  ...
]
```

### Step 5: Kafka Connect with Schema Registry (and Apache Avro)

You may notice that the same schema object is actually embedded in every
single messages, which lead to a huge waste of storage space.
Moreover, there is no schema validation upon the arrival of each message.

To address the above problem, we will need some more components —
enters **Schema Registry** and **Apache Avro**. Avro serialization
and schema registry pair is not a must for Kafka database connection,
but is highly recommended.

Apache Avro is a standard data serialization system.
All the Avro schema are stored in a metadata server with
versioning called Schema Registry.

Let’s try Kafka Connect with Avro serialization:

```shell
# 0. Delete the existing topics: app-users, app-movies
make kafka-shell

kafka-topics --delete --topic app-users --zookeeper $ZK
kafka-topics --delete --topic app-movies --zookeeper $ZK

kafka-topics --create --topic app-users --partitions 2 --zookeeper $ZK --replication-factor 2
kafka-topics --create --topic app-movies --partitions 2 --zookeeper $ZK --replication-factor 2

exit

# 1. Kafka Connect with Avro serialization
# Enter Kafka Connect Shell Client
make connect-shell

# Kafka Connect with avro-standalone setting, connecting via postgres
connect-standalone dev/connect-avro-standalone.properties dev/source-postgres-incremental.properties

# 2. Console consumer with Avro deserialization
# Enter Kafka Avro Shell Client
make avro-shell

# Console Consumer with Avro deserialization
TOPIC=app-users

kafka-avro-console-consumer --bootstrap-server $BROKERS \
 --topic $TOPIC \
 --from-beginning \
 --property print.key=true \
 --property print.value=true \
 --property schema.registry.url=$SCHEMA_REGISTRY \
 --max-messages 20

# Expected console-consumer output from topic: app-users
# null {"id":101,"first_name":"Cass","last_name":"Truss","email":"ctruss0@salon.com"}
# null {"id":102,"first_name":"Joete","last_name":"Scowcroft","email":"jscowcroft1@gizmodo.com"}
# null {"id":103,"first_name":"Celine","last_name":"Wortley","email":"cwortley2@bizjournals.com"}
# null {"id":104,"first_name":"Othilia","last_name":"Gumme","email":"ogumme3@issuu.com"}
# null {"id":105,"first_name":"Maynord","last_name":"Buttrick","email":"mbuttrick4@mashable.com"}
# null {"id":106,"first_name":"Kendall","last_name":"Yitzovitz","email":"kyitzovitz5@storify.com"}
# null {"id":107,"first_name":"Tedi","last_name":"Danne","email":"tdanne6@earthlink.net"}
# null {"id":108,"first_name":"Diena","last_name":"Knight","email":"dknight7@cbsnews.com"}
# null {"id":109,"first_name":"Court","last_name":"Hensmans","email":"chensmans8@over-blog.com"}
# null {"id":110,"first_name":"Lissi","last_name":"Andrea","email":"landrea9@gizmodo.com"}
# ...

# Exit Docker when Kafka Connect is done
(Ctrl-C)
exit
```

To verify if the new data schema is generated,
let us access the registry schema server through its REST API:

- To query the list of schemas, visit http://localhost:8081/subjects;

- To query individual schema (example, app-users-value),
  visit http://localhost:8081/subjects/app-users-value/versions/latest;

```shell
# Check list of available schemas
curl http://localhost:8081/subjects

# Expected output:
# ["app-users-value", "app-movies-value"]

# Check detail of app-users-value schema
curl http://localhost:8081/subjects/app-users-value/versions/latest

# Expected output:
# {
#   "subject": "app-users-value",
#   "version": 1,
#   "id": 2,
#   "schema": "{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"users\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":\"int\"},{\"name\":\"first_name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"last_name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"email\",\"type\":\"string\"}],\"connect.name\":\"users\"}"
# }
```

### Step 6: Kafka / Schema Registry UI

Finally, to put the icing on the cake, we can visit two GUI interfaces
to visualize the Kafka cluster and schema registry.

[Kafdrop](https://github.com/HomeAdvisor/Kafdrop), which is a web interface
for monitoring a Kafka cluster is available at http://localhost:9000.

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/kafdrop.png" alt="kafdrop" />
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</div>

[Schema Registry UI](https://github.com/lensesio/schema-registry-ui),
a web interface for the schema registry, is available at http://localhost:8082.

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/schema-registry-ui.png"
    alt="schema-registry-ui"
  />
  <figcaption>

</div>

### Job done so far

1. We have deployed the Kafka clusters as Docker containers;

1. We have performed CRUD on Kafka topics;

1. We have started a Kafka producer-consumer setup;

1. We have connected a PostgresSQL database using Kafka Connect;

1. We have added the Schema Registry;

1. We have visualized the setup using web-based interfaces,
   namely Kafdrop and schema-registry-ui;

A round of applause for our progress! So far so good,
but it isn’t a complete demo if it’s just running on our local machine.
Now, we will deploy the entire architecture to AWS!

## Cluster Setup on AWS Managed Streaming for Kafka

While AWS MSK is still in its early preview stage (as of January, 2019),
we will deploy an Apache Kafka cluster with the following components:

- Three broker nodes on AWS MSK,

- PostgresSQL database,

- Kafdrop, and

- Kafka Connect running on [AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).

### Prerequisites

- A Linux / MacOS machine,

- An AWS account, with root privilege,

- Latest AWS CLI installed on your machine with pre-configured credentials (using aws configure),

- A Docker Hub account for hosting the Kafka Connect image,

- And again, clone https://github.com/kavimaluskam/kafka-starter 😺.

### Step 1: Create a VPC with 6 subnets

Before setting up any services, a VPC is required as a network interface.
On top of that, we will need 6 subnets:
3 pairs of public and private subnet in 3 available zones.

In case you are not familiarize with AWS VPC and subnets,
please follow this [official AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-public-private-vpc.html)
to complete the setup. You may use the below suggested values for the
required configuration:

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/vpc.png" alt="vpc" />
  <figcaption>Suggested parameter for creating VPC and subnets</figcaption>
</div>

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/vpc-dashboard.png"
    alt="vpc-dashboard"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Created VPC and subnets can be viewed in the VPC dashboard
  </figcaption>
</div>

### Step 2: Create a simple Kafka Cluster on AWS MSK

After creating the VPC and and its subnets, we then create the AWS MSK cluster
through the [MSK dashboard](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/).

The AWS MSK cluster will be running in the private subnets of the newly
created VPC. For the minimal, demonstration purpose, we have only 1 broker
per availability zone (AZ, for short).

Since AWS MSK is still in preview stage, we can only retrieve the created
MSK cluster’s information via the AWS CLI but not MSK dashboard:

```shell
# Assign 1 public subnetID from above subnet setup
SUBNET_ID=${subnetID}

# List all kafka cluster for corrsponding region
aws kafka list-clusters --region us-east-1

# Expected output
# {
#   "ClusterInfoList": [
#     {
#       "EncryptionInfo": {...},
#       "BrokerNodeGroupInfo": {
#         "BrokerAZDistribution": "DEFAULT",
#         "ClientSubnets": [...],
#         "StorageInfo": {...},
#         "SecurityGroups": [...],
#         "InstanceType": "kafka.m5.large"
#       },
#       "ClusterName": "data-kafka",
#       "CurrentBrokerSoftwareInfo": {...},
#       "CreationTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSZ",
#       "NumberOfBrokerNodes": 3,
#       "ZookeeperConnectString": "10.0.xxx.xxx:2181,10.0.xxx.xxx:2181,10.0.xxx.xxx:2181",
#       "State": "ACTIVE",
#       "CurrentVersion": "...",
#       "ClusterArn": "arn:aws:kafka:us-east-1:xxxxxxx:cluster/data-kafka/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-x",
#       "EnhancedMonitoring": "..."
#     }
#   ]
# }

# Assign cluster arn from previous response
ARN=${cluster-arn}

# Get bootstrap brokers for selected cluster
aws kafka get-bootstrap-brokers --cluster-arn $arn --region us-east-1

# Expected output
# {
#   "BootstrapBrokerString": "10.0.xxx.xxx:9092,10.0.xxx.xxx:9092,10.0.xxx.xxx:9092"
# }

# Assign cluster brokers connection for selected cluster
STG_BROKERS=${bootstrap-brokers-string}

# Get zookeeper and other information for selected cluster
aws kafka describe-cluster --cluster-arn $arn --region us-east-1
STG_ZK=${zookeeper-server-string)
```

<figcaption>Retrieve brokers and zookeeper information to proceed</figcaption>

### Step 3: Set up Kafka client and the mock database on AWS EC2 + AWS ECS

Now, we have a Kafka cluster with three broker nodes managed by AWS MSK.
Next, we are deploying the following components:

- PostgresSQL database with mock data,

- Kafdrop, and

- An EC2 instance (namely _containers server_), for hosting the docker image.

We will deploy the above components using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
All the YAML file for this tutorial are created in `aws-setup`.
Simply deploy the two services and containers server via CLI:

```shell
aws cloudformation create-stack \
   --stack-name data-kafka-starter \
   --template-body file://`pwd`/aws-setup/cloudformation.yml \
   --parameters ParameterKey=BootstrapServer,ParameterValue=\"$STG_BROKERS\" ParameterKey=ZookeeperServer,ParameterValue=\"$STG_ZK\" ParameterKey=SubnetID,ParameterValue=\"$SUBNET_ID\" \
   --region us-east-1
```

The deployment may take a few minutes.
You can check the latest progress in the AWS CloudFormation Dashboard.

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/cf1.png" alt="cf1" />
  <figcaption>
    CloudFormation dashboard shows deployment stack’s status and details
  </figcaption>
</div>

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/cf2.png" alt="cf2" />
  <figcaption>
    CloudFormation dashboard also shows deployment progress and events
  </figcaption>
</div>

When the deployment has completed, we then check the containers server
instance created and copy the public IP (`containers_server_ip`).
We shall successfully see the broker statistics via Kafdrop in
http://<containers_server_ip>:9000.

### Step 4: Deploy Kafka Connect Worker on AWS ECS

Now, the environment is ready, and we can try out the data connection on the
cluster by a Kafka Connect task. First, we wrap our Kafka Connect worker
properties into a docker container using the script `connect/stg/build.sh`:

```shell
DOCKER_HUB=${your docker hub account}
DOMAIN=${domain for the containers server created}

sh connect/stg/build.sh -h $DOCKER_HUB -b $STG_BS -d $DOMAIN
```

Similar to what we did in Step 3, we deploy the Kafka Connect service to
AWS ECS using AWS CloudFormation:

```shell
aws cloudformation create-stack \
   --stack-name data-kafka-starter-connect \
   --template-body file://`pwd`/aws-setup/connect-cloudformation.yml \
   --parameters ParameterKey=ImageName,ParameterValue=\"$DOCKER_HUB/kafka-connect-demo\" \
   --region us-east-1
```

We shall see created topics with messages via Kafdrop
for the production environment.

<div class="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="/blogs/2019-02-08-start-kafka/kafdrop-result.png"
    alt="kafdrop-result"
  />
  <figcaption>Finally, database records are saved in MSK cluster!</figcaption>
</div>

### Step 5: Clean up

To clean up the demo setup, we remove the CloudFormation stacks via CLI
(as the second stack is serving in the first stack, we suggest you to
remove the second stack first):

```shell
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name data-kafka-starter-connect
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name data-kafka-starter
```

## Wrapping up

As in a simplified demonstration environment, we are not showcasing
the best deployment practice. You are welcome to extend our example with:

- Schema Registry integration,

- Distributed Kafka Connect workers, etc

As you can observe, it is not trivial to deploy a Kafka cluster on AWS
despite the availability of AWS MSK. Yet, the deployment process should be
more and more streamlined as such a new AWS product matures.

Thanks for reading this long tutorial.
