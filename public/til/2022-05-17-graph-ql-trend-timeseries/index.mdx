Github data is a popular measure of technology trend, especially in recent
web3 study (e.g. [State of crypto report 2022 by a16z](https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/).)

I have been previously asked in an interview for repository fork / dependency
data, and I wrongly decided that we could only scrape latest data and maintain
historical timeseries on our cache / storage, but later I found that Github
does provide data history:

### Repository Fork Timeseries:

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "%s", name: "%s") {
    forks(first: 100, privacy: PUBLIC) {
      nodes {
        name
        owner {
          login
        }
        createdAt # <-- Repository fork time
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Repository Star Timeseries:

```graphql
query {
  topic(name: "%s") {
    stargazers(first: 100) {
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
      edges {
        starredAt # <-- Repository star time
        node {
          url
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
